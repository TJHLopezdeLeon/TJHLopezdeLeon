            <p>Everyone calls me Tim or TJ..I am originally from the Philippines. I migrated to the US back in 2008 and have been working in IT since then.<br> I am taking up a couple of certificate courses in Chaffey to refresh my knowledge and brush up on technology trends.<br> Hopefully I complete all the requirements this spring term so I can proceed in taking an MBA degree.</p>
